## Ingredients

* 1 sweet yellow onion, finely diced
* 1 green bell pepper, finely diced
* 2 bay leaves
* 20 okra pods, chopped
* 1/2 lb andouille sausage, chopped
* 1/2 lb gulf shrimp, peeled and de-veined
* 3 Tbsp grapeseed oil
* 2 Tbsp garlic, minced
* 1 Cup short grain rice
* 2 stalks celery, finely diced
* 3 Tbsp flour
* 1/2 Tbsp crushed red chillies
* 1 Tbsp dried marjoram
* 1 tsp file powder
* 1 medium tomato, finely diced
* 2-1/2 Cups chicken broth
* 1 tsp molasses

## Steps

1.  Prep all veggies.
2.  Add the oil to a large skillet over medium heat.
3.  Add the flour and stir, slowly browing to create a roux.
4.  When the roux reaches a dark brown consistency, add the diced onions, celery, and bell pepper. Add the bay leaves.
5.  Cook until onions are translucent.
6.  Add the garlic, andouille, and okra. Saute until the okra gives off enough of its moisture to create clumps in the mixed vegetables.
7.  Taste and season with salt and freshly-ground black pepper. Add the crushed chillies, marjoram, and file powder.
8.  Add the shrimp, rice, and tomato.
9.  Stir the ingredients together and add the chicken broth. Bring to a simmer and stir, reducing the liquid over medium heat. Add the molasses.
10.  When all the moisture has been incorporated and the rice has become soft, remove the bay leaves, taste for levels of salt and pepper, re-season if necessary, and serve.
4.  When the roux reaches a dark brown consistency, add the diced veggies (except for the garlic) and start to brown.
5.  Cook until onions are transluscent.

Serves 6.
